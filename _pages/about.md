I am a researcher investigating fairness and robustness in large multimodal systems. My primary interests are:

- Lightweight tuning and adaptation strategies that enable efficient bias mitigation in LLMs and LVLMs.
- Understanding how biases emerge and amplify during model compression and distillation and designing targeted mitigation strategies.

During my M.S. (Sogang University) I developed dysarthric speech augmentation and expressive TTS systems, and worked on severity classification and pause-detection pipelines — experiences that shaped my focus on equitable and reliable AI systems in sensitive applications. Current projects include knowledge-grounded evaluation frameworks for bias assessment in text-to-image and vision-language models, and a self-evolving bias detection-correction-explain platform.
