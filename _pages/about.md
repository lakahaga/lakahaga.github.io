I am a researcher focused on building fair and efficient AI systems. My work centers on understanding and mitigating biases in large language and multimodal models, particularly how biases emerge during model compression and distillation.

During my Master's at Sogang University, I developed clinical speech models for dysarthric speech assessment and expressive text-to-speech systems. This experience highlighted how critical fairness and reliability are in AI systems that directly impact people's lives.

Currently at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), I develop evaluation frameworks for bias assessment in text-to-image and vision-language models. My research involves creating human preference datasets that capture diverse perspectives on fairness and designing lightweight adaptation strategies that preserve equity under resource constraints.

I am particularly interested in the tension between model efficiency and fairness—ensuring AI systems remain equitable as we make them more accessible through compression and optimization.

I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities to develop principled evaluation and mitigation strategies for fair multimodal AI systems.
