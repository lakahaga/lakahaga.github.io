### Automated Transcription Error Detection for KSponSpeech
- Developed a framework for automatically detecting and correcting human transcription errors in the KSponSpeech corpus using ASR and language model–based validation.
- Presented the work at Korea Computer Congress (KCC) 2023:  
  A Model-based Method for Automatic Transcription Error Detection in ASR Corpora.
- Published the extended study in the Journal of the Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers (KIISE) (2024).
